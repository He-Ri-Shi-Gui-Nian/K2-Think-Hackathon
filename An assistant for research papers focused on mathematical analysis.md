# Section 1: Problem & User
## Target users
  
  Undergraduate students, graduate students, PhD candidates, and researchers.
  
## Pain points

  The mathematical sections of academic papers often suffer from unclear assumptions or overly concise derivations, making it difficult for readers to follow the reasoning. This hinders comprehension of key technical details, weakens understanding of the overall argument, and even obstructs the development of intuition in the field.

## Importance / urgency

  Reading academic papers is a central part of research and shapes how researchers choose and develop their own directions. Sometimes, an undergraduate, graduate student, or researcher is limited by their mathematical background and cannot fully understand papers in a certain field, forcing them to switch to another area. Yet many of these individuals may actually have strong potential—such as good intuition—and with enough mathematical support, they could make meaningful contributions. Their difficulty often comes not from a lack of effort, but from limitations in their educational background—for example, the quality of instruction at their undergraduate institutions. In math-intensive fields, helping researchers overcome this barrier could remove a major obstacle to understanding the literature and unlock significant research potential.

# Section 2: What You’ll Build
## Core offering

A K2-Think–powered assistant for reading math-intensive papers, helping researchers understand key derivations and logical dependencies.

## User flow

 1. Users can upload a PDF and read it in the GUI, selecting content to query K2-Think for explanations.
 2. The GUI can iteratively ask K2-Think to generate a mind map of the paper’s reasoning structure, which users can edit.
 3. It supports screenshot-based OCR for formulas. Recognized formulas are converted into LaTeX code, which users can review, modify, and label by type (assumptions, equations, theorems, lemmas, derivations, proofs). Processed items are stored in the Math Content List.
 4. Users may also upload their own math content, such as handwritten derivations recognized via OCR or direct LaTeX input.
 5. From the list, users can select items and ask K2-Think questions—for example, “What role does Assumption 1 play in deriving Equation 1?” or “Check whether Derivation 1 contains an error.”
  
## Platform / tech stack
- Overall GUI: PyMuPDF, tkinter
- Screenshot OCR: OpenCV, Pillow (PIL), pytesseract
- Mind-map visualization: GraphML
- OCR for printed/handwritten math formulas: MathPix Convert API

    
## Additional Notes

To ensure reasoning reliability, K2-Think must explicitly list all assumptions before any derivation. This lets users verify premises in advance and prevents logically inconsistent or misleading conclusions.

# Section 3: Why K2 Think

- Academic reading is a continuous cognitive process; long model latency disrupts comprehension. K2-Think’s fast token streaming maintains this flow.
- The main difficulty in math-intensive papers lies in logical reasoning. K2-Think’s advanced mathematical inference capability is perfectly suited for this task.

# Section 4: Demo
  
  A lightweight Python GUI where users upload and read PDFs, capture math content as screenshots for editable LaTeX, save it to a math content list or upload their own LaTeX derivations, and query K2-Think for reasoning explanations based on selected items.
